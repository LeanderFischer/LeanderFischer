### Hey there, welcome to my github profile 🌠

I'm a postdoctoral research scientist at Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) in Zeuthen, Germany. I recently defended my PhD in astroparticle physics, after performing the first search for GeV-scale heavy neutral leptons with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory using 10 years of atmospheric neutrino data.
