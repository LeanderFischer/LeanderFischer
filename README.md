### Hey there, welcome to my github profile 🌠

I'm a research scientist at Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY in Zeuthen, Germany. I'm currently pursuing a PhD in astroparticle physics, performing a search for heavy neutral leptons using atmospheric neutrinos measured by the IceCubu Neutrino Observatory.

* 🗣️ I am proficient in the programming languages $\texttt{Python}$, $\texttt{C++}$, and $\LaTeX$
* 🪛 I am a maintainer of the neutrino oscillation analysis framework [PISA](https://github.com/icecube/pisa)
* 🌱 Currently, I am enhancing my knowledge on [github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
